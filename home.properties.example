## The following properties can be set instead of using environment variables

## Declare the webapp server's directory to compile using web app server libraries
## based on the webapp type configured in build.properties
#CATALINA_HOME=/path/to/tomcat

## CENTRIC_HOME can be used to compile directly to the webapp's deployment
## directory (for development), or to any directory for later generating a .war
#CENTRIC_HOME=/path/to/tomcat/webapps/centric
#CENTRIC_HOME=/path/to/weblogic/domain/autodeploy/directory

## At times, scripts will need to install or upgrade fileLibrary documents when
## deploying from source
#CENTRIC_FILELIBRARY=/path/to/centric/fileLibrary
## To skip web based GUI the fileLibrary must be in the WEB-INF folder, useful
## for development
#CENTRIC_FILELIBRARY=/path/to/apache-tomcat/webapps/centric/WEB-INF/fileLibrary

## If using Axis Web Services, then declare the webapp home so that the
## Centric CRM descriptors can be installed with "ant ws"
#AXIS_HOME=/path/to/apache-tomcat/webapps/axis
